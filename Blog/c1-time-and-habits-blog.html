      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p>
        I particularly enjoyed reading about the correlation between mindfulness and productivity, 
        and the various habits of success.

      <h3>Which will you experiment further with</h3>
      <p>
        I agree with the concept that confidence is just ability displayed and, in that sense, can be developed through our actions.  
        This is something that I am hoping to take ownership of at Dev Academy.  I am also keen to experiement with further meditation 
        (wide interpretation of meditation) as I can see the merits of this, especially in terms of creativity and my ability to approach problems
        from different angles.
