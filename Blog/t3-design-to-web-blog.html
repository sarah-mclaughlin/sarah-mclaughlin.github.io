      <h3>What is a responsive site, and why is responsiveness important?</h3>
      <p>
        A responsive site is a site that responds to the size of the screen of the device.  
        A responsive site will rearrange itself to ensure that it offers a positive user experience 
        across all devices and browsers.
      </p>
      <h3>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        Mobile first desing is an approach to responsive design.  It means to design for smaller screens first, 
        then add more features and content for bigger and bigger screens.
      </p>
      <h3>What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons?</h3>
      <p>
        A web framework is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications. 
        Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development.

      <h3>What is a wireframe, and why do we use it?</h3>
      <p>
        A wireframe is a paper design of a webpage before it is built in code.  Wireframes help to establish the layout 
        of a webpage in terms of columns and rows.  This ensures that the html fundamentals reflect what you want
        to achieve with the page and so you don't have to keep going back and fixing your html structure.

        <h3>What aspects of your wireframes did you find difficult to implement, and why?</h3>
        <p>
          I had some initial difficulty with columns and alignment and working with the different rows, especially 
          when I then wanted to 'flex' rows.  I also spent considerable time working with 'divs' and images to try and 
          get a better understanding of how to best manage image sizing.  I would still like to work on adding a 'nav' 
          panel and social media links if I get time.
