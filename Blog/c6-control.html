      <h3>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
      <p>
        I find in programming, if I get stuck or blocked and can't work it out I can become overwhelmed and frustrated.  
        It is during these times that I might experience shallow breathing or a faster heart-rate.  These moments are a good 
        opportunity for me to practice Siberian North Railroad exercise.

      <h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
      <p>
        I found it an interesting exercise.  I think it is difficult to evaluate its effetciveness because I did it in a relatively 
        relaxed context.  The real test will be implementing this technique when I have been 'triggered'.  I have no doubt that
        the SBNRR approach will have a positive impact in relation to how I deal with and react to my emotions when 'triggered'.
