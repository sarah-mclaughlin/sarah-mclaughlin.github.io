      <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
      <p>
        I learnt that 'mindfulness conversation' is not something that comes easily to me. 
        I will definitely continue to work on this skill, especially in relation to mindful listening and giving people
        my full moment-to-moment attention.  I really want to be more aware of my attention and ensure that when I am 
        listening to a person, that they have my full attention and all of the space and time they need to express themselves.
      </p>
      <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
      <p>
        I like the 'do less than you can' technique.  This way the exercise does not feel like a burden or too much 
        of a challenge.
      </p>
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>
        I found the explanation of the difference between open and focussed attention really interesting.  I am glad that there is 
        value and benefit in training both forms of attention and also training your mind to switch easily between the two.
