      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>
        Reading the chapter 'Even an engineer can thrive on emotional intelligence' taught me that there are 
        five domains of emotional intelligence:
        <ul>
            <li>self-awareness</li>
            <li>self-regulation</li>
            <li>motivation</li>
            <li>empathy; and</li>
            <li>social skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Emotional intelligence is an important quality in a wide range of work spaces and industries.  It the core of what allows individuals to work and succeed as a team.
            Leaders with a high emotional intelligence are better at cultivating open and honest lines of communication within a team/organisation.  What is particularly interesting 
            is that emotional intelligence can be learned. This links to the concept of neuroplasticity and the idea that what we think, do, and pay attention to, changes the structure 
            and function of our brains.  This means that we can intentionally grow and develop our emotional intelligence through training.

      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>
            I enjoyed the two minutes of mindfulness.  It allowed me to bring my attention to my breath and to try and create a mind of just being.
