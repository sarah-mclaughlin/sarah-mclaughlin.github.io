      <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
      <p>
        I think I probably struggled to implement this approach as much as I would have liked to.
        This is likely to be because I was wanting my webpage to look good and so my process in CSS
        was often based around getting my page to look better rather than engaging in the process.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
      <p>
        I thought it was a practice that helped a lot of people with their state of mind which helps them to be more mindful
        throughout their day.
      </p>
      <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
      <p>
        I did not realise so many scientific studies had drawn links between various cognitive functions, physical abiltiies, and 
        even one's immune system.
      </p>
      <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
      <p>
        I like that they take a broad approach to meditation and recognise that you can walk and meditate at the same time.  I also liked the 
        analogy that meditation is similar to riding a bike in relation to your meta-attention in that as your meta-attention 
        stregthens, your ability to recover wandering attention quickly and often improves as well.  This creates the effect of 
        continuous attention, which is concentration.
      </p>
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to see the book break down the traditional body/mind divide and the concept that the two function and are trained
        independently of each other.  I tend to believe that the two are inextricably inter-related and that a healthy, happy body goes a 
        long way to ensuring a healthy, happy mind, and vice versa.
