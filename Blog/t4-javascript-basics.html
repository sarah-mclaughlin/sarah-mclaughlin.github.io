      <h3>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the interactive elements of a website. If HTML is the structure or walls/foundations of a house, 
        and CSS is the design/visual elements, then JavaScript would be the doors and cupboards opening when they are 
        pulled and anything else that moves.

      <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process 
          from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h3>
      <p>
        A control flow sets out the steps that need to be followed to brush your teeth. A loop is then an instruction for the control flow 
        to be repeated when certain conditions are met and until a condition is met. 
      </p>
      <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>
         Data within an object is accessed by using a name while data within an array is accessed by using an index number.
        </p>
      <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
        <p>
        A function is a block of code that performs a task when it is called. It is useful because it can be reused with diffrerent input (arguments)
        to give a different result or data set.
