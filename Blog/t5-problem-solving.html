      <h2>Problem solving</h2>

      <h3>Tell a non-tech friend a problem you got stuck on. What was the problem?</h3>
      <p>
        I was trying to make a block of code so that when certain circles were made either green, blue or invisble, 
        the count for green, blue or invisible increased.  To do this I needed my code to 'loop through' all of my circles 
        checking if they were green, blue or invisible and updating the tally accordingly.  I got stuck on the line of code that 
        explains to the computer what to do if a circle was green, blue or invisible. 
      </p>
      <h3>What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>
        I used the techniques of trying something (guess and check), reading through my materials, and asking my peers for help.  It
        was through asking my peers for help that I was able to solve the problem.  On reflection I recognised that I was probably over-
        thinking the problem and that I maybe just needed to follow the instructions and steps given to us more closely.
      </p>
      <h3>How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>
        Slightly confused, frustrated and overwhelmed but also excited by the challenge and opportunity to learn.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you learn?</h3>
      <p>
        I learnt a lot more about 'for' statements and what you are instructing a computer to do in a 'for' statement. I also feel like I 
        understand 'if' and 'else' statements better as well.
      </p>
      <h3>How confident do you feel using different problem solving techniques and processes?</h3>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pseudocode: Semi confident.  I would really like to use this technique more and more as I grow my knowledge 
                of and familiarity with JavaScript.               
            </li>
            <li>
                Trying something: Very confident, especially when I can easily see the result of what I have tried. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Rubber ducky method: I haven't tried this method/technique yet but I think that it will be a very 
                helpful technique for me to use going forward. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Reading error messages: Semi confident.  I find these helpful if I understand what they are saying.  
                Half of the time I find it difficult to understand what error messages are trying to convey.
            </li>
            <li>
                Console.logging: Not so confident. I have not quite got my head around console.log and exactly what the console is 
                and where to locate it. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Googling: Very confident.  There is so much helpful information out there.
            </li>
            <li>
                Asking your peers for help: Very confident.  The guys and girls at DevAcademy Auckland are awesome.
            </li>
            <li>
                Asking coaches for help: Semi confident.  The coaches are super busy so I try to exhaust other ways of solving
                a problem before asking the coaches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Improving your process with reflection: Reasonably confident.  This has been helpful in relation to certain problems.
                Other problems, even when solved, raise other questions so reflection can get frustrating if there are too many unanswered questions.
                Learning CSS has been a bit like this a we only had a limited time and I feel there is so much I have not yet mastered or
                even touched on in CSS.
