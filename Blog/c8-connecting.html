      <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
      <p>
        I think I am generally a kind and empathetic person and am therefore good at building trusting relationships 
        with other people by sharing in their thoughts and feelings.  I was, however, struck by the sentence "the 
        mere perception of whether or not a person shares your political beliefs can measurably affect how you respond 
        to him/her at an unconscious, neurological level".  I think I can definitely improve on not letting my perceptions 
        of anothers political beliefs be a barrier to my building a trusting relationship with that person.
      </p>
      <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
      <p>
        I think this is a great exercise in demonstrating how, when you trust someone, often that trust will be reciprocated.  
        Often it just takes one person to take the initial risk of being vulnerable to build that relationship of trust. 
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
      <p>
        I found this a really interesting exercise, especially in reminding me how giving kindness is beneficial to both the 
        giver and the recipient.
