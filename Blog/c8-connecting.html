      <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
      <p>
        I think I am generally a kind and empathetic person and am therefore good at building trusting relationships 
        with other people by sharing in their thoughts and feelings.  I was, however, struck by the sentence "the 
        mere perception of whether or not a person shares your political beliefs can measurably affect how you respond 
        to him/her at an unconscious, neurological level".  I think I can definitely improve on not letting my perceptions 
        of anothers political beliefs be a barrier to my building a trusting relationship with that person.
      </p>
      <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
      <p>
        I think this is a great exercise in demonstrating how, when you trust someone, often that trust will be reciprocated.  
        Often it just takes one person to take the initial risk of being vulnerable to build that relationship of trust. 
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
      <p>
        I found this a really interesting exercise, especially in reminding me how giving kindness is beneficial to both the 
        giver and the recipient.

      <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
      <p>
        I live in a flat of five other people.  Our fridge sometimes becomes very full with food bits that slowly decay and 
        become mouldy as noone thinks the food is theirs.  Sometimes I go through the fridge and throw out food that has gone off 
        or scraps that don't look like are going to be eaten.  My flatmate once became upset with me because I threw out his 
        one piece of white bread that he had left in the fridge.  I understand that, from his perspective, he did not like his food 
        being thrown out.  It was a simple mistake and we have since moved past this.
      </p>
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>
        I found this chapter an interesting attempt to break down and provide techniques to aid with basic human interactions. 
        I think this is quite difficult to do as a lot of human interaction is learned at a young age and becomes instinctual.  
        I think this is more a chapter about putting yourself in another persons shoes to see things from their perspective in 
        order to move forward from a disagreement/misunderstanding.
