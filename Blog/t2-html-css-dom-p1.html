        <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
        <p>HTML code is like the walls and foundations of a house.  CSS is then what you put on the walls and foundations to 
            make the house visually appealing, and the DOM is the HTML you write once it is passed by the browser and is viewed in DevTools.  
            The DOM might be different from the HTML code as the DOM filters your code for errors.</p>
        <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
        <p>'Boxifying' is looking at a webpage and breaking it down into boxes.  These 
            boxes are then the subject of what is being 'designed up' in CSS</p>
        <h3>What is the box model</h3>
        <p>The box model shows the structure and format of a single box on a webpage.
            A box is made up of the content, padding, border and margin.</p>
