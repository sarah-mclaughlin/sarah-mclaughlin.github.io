      <h2>This is my cultural reflection</h2>
    </div> 
    <div class="text">
      <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>
        My initial take on the DBC/EDA experience is that it does away 
        with the default understanding that learning is simply the exchange 
        of fees for information. I get the sense that EDA would like to really 
        foster a culture of curiosity and an environment where learning is 
        student driven and the teachers assist/aid with this.
      </p>
      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>
        See question 1.
      </p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>
        I see myself fitting into this culture well.  I am genuinely interested 
        in what can be achieved through coding and web development.
      </p>
      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
      <p>
        My expectations are unchanged. EDA has far exceeded 
        my expectations so far so I am excited to see where it will take me.
      </p>
      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>
        Very excited.  A little nervous as I feel very new to all of this.
