    <h1>This is my cultural reflection</h1>

    <1. What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?

    My initial take on the DBC/EDA experience is that it does away with the default understanding that learning is simply the exchange of fees for information. I get the sense that EDA would like to really foster a culture of curiosity and an environment where learning is student driven and the teachers assist/aid with this.

    2. What are your impressions?

    See question 1.

    3. How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?  
    
    I see myself fitting into this culture well.  I am genuinely interested in what can be achieved through coding and web development.

    4. Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?

    My expectations are unchanged. EDA has far exceeded my expectations so far so I am excited to see where it will take me.

    5. Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?

    Very excited.  A little nervous as I feel very new to all of this.
