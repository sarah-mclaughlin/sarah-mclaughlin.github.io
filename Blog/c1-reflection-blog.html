      <h2>This is my cultural reflection</h2>
    </header>

    <p>1. What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</p>

    <p>My initial take on the DBC/EDA experience is that it does away with the default understanding that learning is simply the exchange of fees for information. I get the sense that EDA would like to really foster a culture of curiosity and an environment where learning is student driven and the teachers assist/aid with this.</p>

    <p>2. What are your impressions?</p>

    <p>See question 1.</p>

    <p>3. How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</p>
    
    <p>I see myself fitting into this culture well.  I am genuinely interested in what can be achieved through coding and web development.</p>

    <p>4. Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</p>

    <p>My expectations are unchanged. EDA has far exceeded my expectations so far so I am excited to see where it will take me.</p>

    <p>5. Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</p>

    <p>Very excited.  A little nervous as I feel very new to all of this.</p>
