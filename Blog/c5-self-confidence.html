      <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
      <p>
        Self awareness helps us to percieve our emotions with more clarity allowing us to be more mindful and vice versa.
      </p>
      <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). 
          What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
      <p>
        I found the body scan exercise useful.  I found it interesting how it relaxed my body and almost helped me pinpoint
         areas where I might be 'carrying stress'.  I like that the body scan uses awareness of the body to create awareness 
         of the mind and expands on the idea that the mind and body are linked.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
        <p>
          I think I have been going through my day-to-day knowing that my emotions are what I am feeling, not who I am, and that, 
          if I apply this thinking, I gain control over my emotions. I could however always be quicker to apply this thinking in 
          situations that challenge me emotionally.
