      <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
      <p>
        Since resigning from my job at a corporate law firm and starting with DevAcademy, life has become a lot more centred around 
        higher purpose and passion, than pleasure.  Of course I still enjoy the moments when concepts 'click' but a big part of my 
        enjoyment from DevAcademy stems from my exploration of higher purpose with the view to eventually finding alignment.
      </p>
      <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise, what are your core values and what do you stand for?</h3>
      <p>
        My core values would be kindness, compassion, and always being genuine and true to yourself.  In my work I am not driven by money 
        or authority, I am driven by creating something new, doing something meaningful, bringing about positive change etc.  I stand for 
        following your gut intinct and being the change you want to see in the world.
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
      <p>
        It was interesting to observe the emotions I experienced when thinking of times of significant failure and success.  I noticed that I 
        found it difficult let the emotions that I felt when I thought about a significant failure pass through.  This is something I 
        can work on.
      </p>
      <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
      <p>
        I love the quote "If your idea of exploration is to always know where you are and to be inside your zone of competence, you don’t do wild new shit. 
        You have to be confused, upset, think you’re stupid. If you’re not willing to do that, you can’t go outside the box."
