        <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
        <p>
            Grid based design is used to bring accuracy to the layout of a webapge. 
            It is the idea that a design is based on a grid. This makes the design 
            easier to re-create as a webpage.  Usually a webpage 'grid' has 12 columns 
            and numerous rows defined by 'classes' in the html file.
        </p>
        <h3>What is all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
        <p>
            Responsive webpages are webpages where the display changes to fit the size of
            the viewing screen.  This means users will have a positive experience of the 
            webpage on all types of devices.
        </p>
        <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
        <p>
            Semantic markup is a way of writing and structuring an HTML so that it 
            reinforces the meaning of the content rather than its appearance. 
            It means that your site architecture separates presentation from content; 
            essentially saying that HTML is used for structure and CSS is used for 
            the style of your web design.
        </p>
        <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
        <p>
            I enjoyed learning about the functions img-responsive, box-sizing and 
            reading-area, and am looking forward to expereimenting with these further.
